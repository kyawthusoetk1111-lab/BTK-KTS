/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict, multi-tiered security model.
 * A core principle is path-based ownership, where a user's private data, such as quizzes and questions,
 * is stored in a hierarchical structure under their unique user ID. This provides strong, inherited
 * security guarantees. For globally accessible data like exam results, security is managed via a
 * denormalized `userId` field within the document itself, ensuring users can only access their own records.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}/... : All user-specific data, including their profile, quizzes, sections, and questions,
 *   is nested under this path. This creates a secure data silo for each user.
 * - /passages/{passageId}/... : A top-level collection for public, read-only content that can be shared across quizzes.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Default Deny: All paths are closed by default. Access must be explicitly granted.
 * - Strict Ownership: All data under `/users/{userId}` is strictly accessible only to the authenticated
 *   user whose UID matches `{userId}`.
 * - No User Listing: The rules do not allow for querying the top-level `/users` collection, preventing
 *   the exposure of the user base.
 * - Secure Result Handling: Exam results are stored in a subcollection under the user, e.g.,
 *   `/users/{userId}/examResults/{examResultId}`. This path-based ownership guarantees that
 *   users can only read, write, and query their own results.
 * - Public Read-Only Content: The `/passages` collection is publicly readable by any user, but all write
 *   operations are disabled to protect shared content integrity.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * To ensure high-performance and secure authorization, this ruleset relies on denormalization.
 * - Path-based Ownership: Instead of using `get()` calls to check ownership, the user's ID is part of the
 *   document path (e.g., `/users/{userId}/...`), making ownership checks instantaneous.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The data model separates private user data (`/users/{userId}/quizzes`) from public shared data (`/passages`).
 * This segregation simplifies rules, improves query performance, and enhances security by preventing accidental
 * cross-collection data exposure.
